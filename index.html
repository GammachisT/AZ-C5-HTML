    <h2>1.1. Learn web development fundamentals</h2> <!-- This is heading 2-->
    <p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals, including an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>1.2. Choose a Development Specialization</h2>
    <p>As you continue to grow your skills, you’ll need to choose an area of specialization. But what are the types of web development? All Web Developers are categorized into three main types:</p>
    <div>
        <dl class="dl"> <!-- This is definition lists-->
            <dt>Front-End Developer</dt>
                <dd>A Front-End Developer works on the <q>client-side</q> of web development, meaning any portion of the site or app that users interact with. This can include a site’s layout, design, and the way users interact with it.</dd>
            <dt>Back-End Developer</dt>
                <dd>A Back-End Developer works on the <q>server-side</q> of web development. This is focused on the way a site functions and can include databases, servers, networks and hosting, and more.</dd>
            <dt>Full-Stack Developer</dt>
                <dd>A Full-Stack Developer is familiar with both front-and back-end development and works with both sides of a website.</dd>
        </dl>
    </div>
    <h2>1.3. Learn Key Programming Languages for Web Development</h2>
    <p>Three families of programming languages form the basic tools involved in virtually all aspects of web development:</p>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</li>
            <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>1.4. Build Projects to Develop Your Web Developer Skills</h2>
    <p>With a grasp of the basics in <b>HTML, CSS,</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>, and a foundation of programming skills, you’re ready to begin building. As you go, you’ll gain experience using an ever-growing set of Web Developer skills. Some of these are technical skills, or <q>hard</q> skills, like programming in <u>SQL</u> or <u>Python</u>, using the jQuery library of functions for more efficient programming, or using tools like Git for version control. The best way to improve these web development skills is simply to start messing around – the more you use them, the better you’ll be.</p>
    <h2>1.5. Build a Web Development Portfolio</h2>
    <p>There are three things to <i>keep in mind</i> when building a portfolio that will stand out from the pack.</p>
    <p>First, your Web Developer portfolio should include a diverse selection of web development work. You don’t want to use every project you’ve ever worked on – your professional portfolio should be a highlight reel that not only demonstrates your best work, but shows your versatility. You want to be selective and highlight your best work, but your selection should be diverse enough that it demonstrates a solid understanding of the various elements of the position. When applying for Web Developer jobs, do a bit of research into the company and the role you’re looking to fill – then refine your portfolio even further, editing out unrelated examples and spotlighting your most relevant work.</p>
